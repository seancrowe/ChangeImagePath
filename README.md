# ChangeImagePath-Fixit
Change image path with random upload folder

When you point this application to a document, XML manipulation is made to add to a document an event action with id of "sean-action". The action contains the javascript that can be found here: https://repl.it/@scrowe/TEMP-Set-date-on-variable-path.

The app goes through all the variables and changes the upload directory to the variable UploadDirectory (it also adds that variable as a hidden variable). If you have image variables that you don't want to be set to this directory, you need to reset them manually after the app is ran.
